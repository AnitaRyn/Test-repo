# sql-challenge

I started by sketching out an ERD which I used for creating tables in pgadmin.Once imported, I checked that the tables were accurate and then imoprted CSV files into the tables of my Employees_DB. Once the dabase was complete, I checked each table and ran the requested queries.

Then, I imported my database to Pandas. 

I created a histogram using the salaries table.
